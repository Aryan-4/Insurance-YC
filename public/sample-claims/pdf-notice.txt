HOW TO USE SAMPLE FILES:

We've provided sample text files that you can use for testing the application:

1. EASIEST METHOD (Recommended):
   - Simply upload the .txt files directly (claim1.txt, claim2.txt, claim3.txt, sample1.txt, etc.)
   - The application will process these text files properly

2. ALTERNATIVE METHOD (If you want to test PDF functionality):
   - Download any of the .txt files provided here
   - Rename them to .pdf (e.g., rename sample1.txt to sample1.pdf)
   - Upload the renamed file to the application
   - The application will detect it's actually a text file and process it correctly

3. REAL PDF TESTING:
   If you want to test with real PDFs, you can find sample insurance claim forms at:

   - https://www.sampleforms.com/insurance-claim-form-sample.html

NOTE: The app is designed to extract the "insured party" from these files and match it against the internal database.
